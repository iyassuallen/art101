<h1> Challenge </h1>
<p>Create pseudocode for an everyday task and a actually coding mechanic of some sort.</p>
<h1> Problems </h1>
<p>Knowing how specific to get with the code, so that it is applicable and anyone could understand it. Aswell as knowing the proper indentation for list in the JS file. </p>
<h1> Results </h1>
<p> Task 1 Description: Cooking a chicken breast with basci seasoning on a pan.
	//Pseudocode for cooking a chicken breast:
//Make sure you have all the tools and ingredients (Chicken breast, seasonings of your choice (ex: salt and pepper), pan, oven, knife (optional), olive oil (or some oil of your choice), meat mallet (preferred), and a cutting board of some sort.
	//Ensure the chicken breast is fully thawed (the best method is to leave it in the fridge for at least 24 hours).
	//Evenly flatten chicken breast with a meat mallet on your cutting board.
	//Apply a generous amount of salt and a couple of pinches of pepper to both sides.
	//Allow chicken to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.
	//Preheat the pan for 2 minutes over medium heat.
	//Apply 2 tbs of olive oil to the pan, making sure to cover the pan fully.
	//Let the oil heat up for 30 seconds.
	//Apply chicken breasts to the pan, and let it sit for 4 minutes.
	//Flip the chicken breast, and let it sit for 3 minutes.
//Let the chicken breast sit for 5 minutes before cutting into it, and enjoy.

Task 2 Description: Creating a double jump mechanic in a video game, when already having a jump mechanic of some sort.
//Already have a jumping mechanic setup.
	//Create a value that counts the number of available jumps for your player, set it to 2.
	//Create a condition that when the player jumps, 1 unit of the available jumps is depleted and they cannot jump if that value is at 0.
//Create a boolean that checks if your player is grounded (if the player's model is colliding with the ground).
	//Reset the value of the available jumps to 2 if the grounded boolean is true. </p>
