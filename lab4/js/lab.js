  //Ensure the chicken breast is fully thawed (the best method is to leave it in the fridge for at least 24 hours).
  //Evenly flatten chicken breast with a meat mallet on your cutting board.
  //Apply a generous amount of salt and a couple of pinches of pepper to both sides.
  //Allow chicken to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.
  //Preheat the pan for 2 minutes over medium heat.
  //Apply 2 tbs of olive oil to the pan, making sure to cover the pan fully.
  //Let the oil heat up for 30 seconds.
  //Apply chicken breasts to the pan, and let it sit for 4 minutes.

//Pseudocode for a double-jump in a video game.
//Already have a jumping mechanic setup.
  //Create a value that counts the number of available jumps for your player, set it to 2.
  //Create a condition that when the player jumps, 1 unit of the available jumps is depleted and they cannot jump if that value is at 0.
//Create a boolean that checks if your player is grounded (if the player's model is colliding with the ground).
  //Reset the value of the available jumps to 2 if the grounded boolean is true.
